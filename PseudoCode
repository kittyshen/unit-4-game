Pseudocode your program and break the app down into tiny, manageable fragments. 
This will make the coding process much less frustrating and a veritable Mach number faster. 
Otherwise, you'll be chipping away at a giant chunk of abstraction for way too many hours.

# CrystalsCollector Game
Pseudocode 
Step1 Create a div to display a random number from 19 - 120 with the number showing as targetScore
Step2 Create a div to hold the user win score and user lose score
Step3 Create 4 div to hold 4 separate elements, called id="crystalContainer" 
Step4 Generate 4 random number from 1 - 12 , with the number hidden
Step5 Check to see if the 4 random number contain at least one odd number
Step6 If at least one is an odd number then push the 4 numbers into an array called crystalPointsArray.
Step7 Using a for loop to Generate new jQuery div elements called addCrystal
Step8 assign addCrystal.attr("data-points") = crystalPointsArray[i]
Step9 set .attr("class", "col-md-3 col-sm-6") to make the webpage responsive to different screen viewport
Step10 add .attr("data-points") = crystalPointsArray[i]
Step11 add a class of "class = crystals" for future click event to those 4 elements and 
Step12 Append the above elements into the "crystalContainer" div in index.html
Step13 Declare a new variable to calculate the currentPoints
Step14 Detect the user click using jQuery on() method. get the number stored in data-points attribute
Step15 add the data-points value to currentPoints variable
Step16 if currentPoints > targetScore lose ++, if currentPoints = targetScore win ++
Step17 either ending condition meet in Step16 will point the game session pointer to Step 1 and repeat
